🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+
Docker
Kubernetes (kubectl)
AWS CLI
Terraform
Jenkins
🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/aniketpuro/Background-Remover-Python-ON-AWS-by-Kubernetes.git
cd Background-Remover-Python-ON-AWS-by-Kubernetes
```
2. Set Up the Environment
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Build and Run the Docker Container
bash
Copy code
docker build -t background-remover-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 background-remover-app
4. Deploy on Kubernetes
Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
5. Set Up AWS Infrastructure
Navigate to the terraform directory and initialize Terraform:

bash
Copy code
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
This will set up the necessary AWS infrastructure, including an EKS cluster for running Kubernetes.

6. Set Up Jenkins Pipeline
Configure Jenkins with the provided JenkinsPipelineScript.sh for automated CI/CD.
Ensure Jenkins has access to your Kubernetes cluster and AWS.
